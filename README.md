# MoviesApp

A Simple frontend built with React which shows the Movie Details and a button to play the trailer. Movie Details are coming from the backend SpringBoot APIs which inturn gets the data from Mongo database.

Also, there is a Reviews Componenet using which a user can give reviews for the movie which is stored in Mongo database.

Need to add more features for login and register and functionality to show reviews per user.

Here are few snapshots
